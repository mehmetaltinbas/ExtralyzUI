A platform that helps users efficiently process and study materials. Users can upload documents in formats like PDF, DOCX or TXT with AI-powered text extraction. Instead of extracting key sentences, the app uses ChatGPTâ€™s API for abstractive summarization, generating human-like summaries in selected length. It also creates interactive practice exercises, including fill-in-the-blank and multiple-choice questions, using AI-driven content analysis. This web app idea came out from my own need as a student.
